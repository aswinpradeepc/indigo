Works and documents
===================

.. note::

    For a full guide to creating a work, see the `Laws.Africa editors guide <https://docs.laws.africa/>`_.

A work is an Act, a by-law, a regulation, and so on. In Indigo, a work doesn't
have any content -- it's just a description of the basic details of the act (or
by-law, etc.). A work can be associated with many documents, each of which is an
*expression* of the work.

An Indigo work is uniquely identified by its FRBR URI. Documents are linked to a work through a common FRBR URI.

Documents inherit a number of fields from a work, such as the FRBR URI, publication date, repeal status, etc.
These details are managed at the work level, not at the document level.

You must create a work before you can import a new document.

Creating a work
---------------

To create a new work:

1. Navigate to the country in which you wish to create the work.
2. Click the **Works tab**.
3. Click the **New work** button.
4. Fill in the details of the work and click **Create**.

Importing a document
--------------------

Indigo is mostly used to import existing documents in either PDF or Word format.

To import a new document:

1. Navigate to the work you wish to import a document for.
2. Click **Manage points in time**.
3. At the appropriate date, click **Import document**.
4. Choose the file to upload, adjust the settings, and click **Go for it!**

If there are no dates on the timeline, either configure a publication date for the work, or add a consolidation date.
