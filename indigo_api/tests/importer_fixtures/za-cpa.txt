        PARAGRAPH (b)

    SECTION 9. - Reasonable grounds for differential treatment in specific circumstances

      SUBSECTION (1)

        It is not a contravention of section 8 for a supplier to—

        PARAGRAPH (a)

          refuse to supply or provide access to any particular goods or services to a minor, or to require the consent of a parent, guardian or other responsible adult before supplying or providing access to any particular goods or services to an unemancipated minor—

          SUBPARAGRAPH (i)

            in accordance with any public regulation; or

          SUBPARAGRAPH (ii)

            as a reasonable precaution to protect the health, welfare or safety of a minor;

        PARAGRAPH (b)

          refuse on reasonable grounds to—

          SUBPARAGRAPH (ii)

            continue, or renew, an agreement contemplated in subparagraph (i), unless the supplier has reason to believe that the minor is emancipated;

        PARAGRAPH (c)

          reasonably designate any facility or service, permanently, or from time to time, for the exclusive use of—

          SUBPARAGRAPH (i)

            minors generally;

          SUBPARAGRAPH (ii)

            minors who are above or below a specified age, or between specified ages; or

          SUBPARAGRAPH (iii)

            adults who have attained a specified age of at least 60 years; or

        PARAGRAPH (d)

          advertise, offer or agree to supply, or supply, any goods or services at a discounted price solely on the basis that the consumer—

          SUBPARAGRAPH (i)

            is a minor who has not yet attained a specified age; or

          SUBPARAGRAPH (ii)

            is an adult who has attained a specified age of at least 60 years.

      SUBSECTION (2)

        It is not a contravention of section 8 for a supplier to reasonably—

        PARAGRAPH (a)

          provide and designate separate but substantially equivalent facilities for the exclusive use of persons of each gender; or

        PARAGRAPH (b)

          offer to supply or provide access to a facility exclusively to persons of one gender.

      SUBSECTION (3)

        It is not a contravention of section 8 for a supplier to market any goods or services in a manner that implies or expresses a preference for a particular group of consumers who are distinguishable from the general population on the basis of a ground of discrimination set out in section 9(3) of the Constitution, if the particular goods or services are reasonably intended or designed to satisfy any specific needs or interests that are common to, or uniquely characteristic of, that particular group of consumers.

      SUBSECTION (4)

        Nothing in this section is intended to limit the authority of a court to—

        PARAGRAPH (a)

          assess the reasonableness of any conduct, to the extent contemplated in subsections (1)(b) or (c), (2) or (3), and determine whether any conduct not reasonably justified, as contemplated in those subsections, constitutes unfair discrimination within the meaning of the Constitution or the Promotion of Equality and Prevention of Unfair Discrimination Act; or

        PARAGRAPH (b)

          determine whether any conduct contemplated in section 8 was fair in the circumstances of a particular transaction or the marketing of any particular goods or services, as the case may be.

    SECTION 10. - Equality court jurisdiction over this Part

      SUBSECTION (1)

        In respect of an alleged contravention of this Part, an accredited consumer protection group, or any person contemplated in section 20(1) of the Promotion of Equality and Prevention of Unfair Discrimination Act, may either—

        PARAGRAPH (a)

          institute proceedings before an equality court in terms of Chapter 4 of that Act; or

        PARAGRAPH (b)

          file a complaint with the Commission, which must refer the complaint to the equality court, if the complaint appears to be valid.

      SUBSECTION (2)

        In any proceedings contemplated in this Part—

        PARAGRAPH (a)

          there is a presumption that any differential treatment contemplated in section 8 is unfair discrimination, unless it is established that the discrimination is fair; and

        PARAGRAPH (b)

          a court may draw an inference that a supplier has discriminated unfairly if—

          SUBPARAGRAPH (i)

            the supplier has done anything contemplated in section 8 with respect to a consumer in a manner that constituted differential treatment compared to that accorded to another consumer;

          SUBPARAGRAPH (ii)

            in the circumstances, the differential treatment appears to be based on a prohibited ground of discrimination; and

          SUBPARAGRAPH (iii)

            the supplier, when called upon to do so, has refused or failed to offer an alternative reasonable and justifiable explanation for the difference in treatment.

        PARAGRAPH (c)

          in the case of an approach other than in person, to pre-emptively block,

        any approach or communication to that person, if the approach or communication is primarily for the purpose of direct marketing.

      SUBSECTION (2)

        To facilitate the realisation of each consumer’s right to privacy, and to enable consumers to efficiently protect themselves against the activities contemplated in subsection (1), a person who has been approached for the purpose of direct marketing may demand during or within a reasonable time after that communication that the person responsible for initiating the communication desist from initiating any further communication.

      SUBSECTION (3)

        The Commission may establish, or recognise as authoritative, a registry in which any person may register a pre-emptive block, either generally or for specific purposes, against any communication that is primarily for the purpose of direct marketing.

      SUBSECTION (4)

        PARAGRAPH (a)

          purchase any other particular goods or services from that supplier;

          enter into an additional agreement or transaction with the same supplier or a designated third party; or

        PARAGRAPH (c)

          unless the supplier—

          SUBPARAGRAPH (i)

            can show that the convenience to the consumer in having those goods or services bundled outweighs the limitation of the consumer’s right to choice;

          SUBPARAGRAPH (ii)

          SUBPARAGRAPH (ii)

            the supplier may cancel the agreement 20 business days after giving written notice to the consumer of a material failure by the consumer to comply with the agreement, unless the consumer has rectified the failure within that time;

          of not more than 80, nor less than 40, business days before the expiry date of the fixed term of the consumer agreement, the supplier must notify the consumer in writing or any other recordable form, of the impending expiry date, including a notice of—

          SUBPARAGRAPH (i)

    SECTION 18. - Consumer’s right to choose or examine goods

      SUBSECTION (1)

        Despite any statement or notice to the contrary, a consumer is not responsible for any loss or damage to any goods displayed by a supplier, unless the loss or damage results from action by the consumer amounting to gross negligence or recklessness, malicious behaviour or criminal conduct.

      SUBSECTION (3)

        If the consumer has agreed to purchase goods solely on the basis of a description or sample, or both, provided by the supplier, the goods delivered to the consumer must in all material respects and characteristics correspond to that which an ordinary alert consumer would have been entitled to expect based on the description or on a reasonable examination of the sample, as the case may be.

      SUBSECTION (4)

        If a supply of goods is by sample, as well as by description, it is not sufficient that any of the goods correspond with the sample if the goods do not also correspond with the description.

      SUBSECTION (1)

          SUBPARAGRAPH (i)

            on the agreed date and at the agreed time, if any, or otherwise within a reasonable time after concluding the transaction or agreement;

        PARAGRAPH (b)

          the agreed place of delivery of goods or performance of services is the supplier’s place of business, if the supplier has one, and if not, the supplier’s residence; and

        PARAGRAPH (c)

          goods to be delivered remain at the supplier’s risk until the consumer has accepted delivery of them, in accordance with this section.

      SUBSECTION (3)

        If an agreement does not provide a specific date or time for delivery of any goods or performance of any services, the supplier must not require that the consumer accept delivery or performance of the services at an unreasonable time.

      SUBSECTION (4)

        The consumer is regarded to have accepted delivery of any goods on the earliest of the following circumstances:

        PARAGRAPH (a)

          When the consumer expressly or implicitly communicates to the supplier that the consumer has accepted delivery of such goods; or

        PARAGRAPH (b)

          when the goods have been delivered to the consumer, and—

          SUBPARAGRAPH (i)

            the consumer does anything in relation to the goods that would be inconsistent with the supplier’s ownership of them; or

          SUBPARAGRAPH (ii)

            after the lapse of a reasonable time, the consumer retains the goods without intimating to the supplier that the consumer has rejected delivery of them, subject to subsection (5).

      SUBSECTION (5)

        When a supplier tenders delivery to a consumer of any goods, the supplier must, on request, allow the consumer a reasonable opportunity to examine those goods for the purpose of ascertaining whether the consumer is satisfied that the goods—

        PARAGRAPH (a)

          are of a type and quality reasonably contemplated in the agreement, and meet the tests set out in section 18(3) and (4); and

        PARAGRAPH (b)

          in the case of a special-order agreement, reasonably conform to the material specifications of the special order.

      SUBSECTION (6)

        If the supplier tenders the delivery of goods or the performance of any services at a location, on a date or at a time other than as agreed with the consumer, the consumer may either—

        PARAGRAPH (a)

          accept the delivery or performance at that location, date and time;

          require the delivery or performance at the agreed location, date and time, if that date and time have not yet passed; or

        PARAGRAPH (c)

          cancel the agreement without penalty, treating any delivered goods or performed services as unsolicited goods or services in accordance with section 21.

      SUBSECTION (7)

        If the supplier delivers to the consumer a larger quantity of goods than the consumer agreed to buy, the consumer may either—

        PARAGRAPH (a)

          reject all of the delivered goods; or

        PARAGRAPH (b)

          accept delivery of the goods, and—

            pay for the agreed quantity at the agreed rate; and

          SUBPARAGRAPH (ii)

            treat the excess quantity as unsolicited goods in accordance with section 21.

      SUBSECTION (8)

        If the supplier delivers to the consumer some of the goods the supplier agreed to supply mixed with goods of a different description not contemplated in the agreement, the consumer may—

          accept delivery of the goods that are in accordance with the agreement and reject the rest; or

        PARAGRAPH (b)

          reject all of the delivered goods.

      SUBSECTION (1)

        PARAGRAPH (b)

          any other right in law between a supplier and consumer to return goods and receive a refund.

      SUBSECTION (2)

        Subject to subsections (3) to (6), the consumer may return goods to the supplier, and receive a full refund of any consideration paid for those goods, if the supplier has delivered—

        PARAGRAPH (a)

          goods to the consumer in terms of an agreement arising out of direct marketing, and the consumer has rescinded that agreement during the coolingoff period, in accordance with section 16;

        PARAGRAPH (b)

          goods that the consumer did not have an opportunity to examine before delivery, and the consumer has rejected delivery of those goods for any of the reasons contemplated in section 19(5);

        PARAGRAPH (c)

          a mixture of goods, and the consumer has refused delivery of any of those goods, as contemplated in section 19(8); or

        PARAGRAPH (d)

          goods intended to satisfy a particular purpose communicated to the supplier as contemplated in section 55(3), and within 10 business days after delivery to

        the consumer, the goods have been found to be unsuitable for that particular purpose.

      SUBSECTION (3)

        Subsection (2) does not apply with respect to any goods if—

        PARAGRAPH (a)

          for reasons of public health or otherwise, a public regulation prohibits the return of those goods to a supplier once they have been supplied to, or at the direction of, a consumer; or

        PARAGRAPH (b)

          after having been supplied to, or at the direction of, the consumer, the goods have been partially or entirely disassembled, physically altered, permanently installed, affixed, attached, joined or added to, blended or combined with, or embedded within, other goods or property.

      SUBSECTION (6)

        In determining the right of a supplier to impose a charge contemplated in subsection (5), if any goods returned to the supplier in terms of this section are—

        PARAGRAPH (a)

          in the original unopened packaging, the supplier may not charge the consumer any amount in respect of the goods;

        PARAGRAPH (b)

          in their original condition and repackaged in their original packaging, the supplier may charge the consumer a reasonable amount for—

          SUBPARAGRAPH (i)

            use of the goods during the time they were in the consumer’s possession, unless they are goods that are ordinarily consumed or depleted by use, and no such consumption or depletion has occurred; or

          SUBPARAGRAPH (ii)

            any consumption or depletion of the goods, unless that consumption or depletion is limited to a reasonable amount necessary to determine whether the goods were acceptable to the consumer; or

        PARAGRAPH (c)

          in any other case, the supplier may charge the consumer a reasonable amount—

          SUBPARAGRAPH (i)

            as contemplated in paragraph (b); and

          SUBPARAGRAPH (ii)

            for necessary restoration costs to render the goods fit for re-stocking, unless, having regard to the nature of the goods, and the manner in which they were packaged, it was necessary for the consumer to destroy the packaging in order to determine whether the goods—

            SUBPARAGRAPH (aa)

              conformed to the description or sample provided, in the case of goods that had not been examined by the consumer before delivery, as contemplated in subsection (2)(b); or

            SUBPARAGRAPH (bb)

              were fit for the intended purpose, in a case contemplated in subsection (2)(d).

    SECTION 21. - Unsolicited goods or services

      SUBSECTION (1)

        For the purpose of this Act, goods or services are unsolicited in any of the following circumstances, subject to subsection (2):

        PARAGRAPH (a)

          If, during any direct marketing of goods or services, a supplier or person acting on behalf of a supplier has left any goods with, or performed any service for, a consumer without requiring or arranging payment for them, those goods or services, as the case may be, are unsolicited;

        PARAGRAPH (b)

          if a consumer is a party to an agreement contemplating the periodic delivery of goods during the life of the agreement, and—

          SUBPARAGRAPH (i)

            during the course of that agreement, the supplier introduces goods or services that are materially different from the goods or services previously supplied to an extent not reasonably contemplated in the agreement, the new goods or services are unsolicited, unless the consumer expressly consented to the material change; or

          SUBPARAGRAPH (ii)

            after the termination of that agreement, the supplier delivers any further goods to the consumer, other than in terms of a different agreement or transaction, those further goods are unsolicited goods;

        PARAGRAPH (c)

          if a supplier delivers goods or performs services at a location, date or time other than as agreed, and the consumer has rejected that delivery or performance of services, as contemplated in section 19(6), those goods or services are unsolicited;

        PARAGRAPH (d)

          if a supplier delivers a larger quantity of goods than the consumer agreed to buy, the excess goods are unsolicited unless the consumer has rejected the entire delivery, as contemplated in section 19(7)(a); or

        PARAGRAPH (e)

          if any goods have been delivered to, or any services performed for, a consumer by or on behalf of a supplier without the consumer having expressly or implicitly requested that delivery or performance, the goods or services, as the case may be, are unsolicited goods.

      SUBSECTION (2)

        Despite subsection (1), if—

        PARAGRAPH (a)

          within 10 business days after delivery of any goods to a consumer, the supplier informs the consumer that the goods were delivered in error, those goods become unsolicited only if the supplier fails to recover them within 20 business days after so informing the consumer; or

        PARAGRAPH (b)

          any goods are delivered to a consumer and—

          SUBPARAGRAPH (i)

            those goods are clearly addressed to another person, and have obviously been misdelivered; or

          SUBPARAGRAPH (ii)

            having regard to the circumstances of the delivery, if would be apparent to the ordinary alert consumer that the goods were intended to be delivered to another person,

          not limit or restrict capacity to supply any such goods or services in response to the acceptance of the offer, on any basis other than that it applies to such a supply in exchange for any other form of consideration;

            paying any consideration to the promoter for the prize; or

            satisfying any further requirements other than those stipulated in terms of subsection (5).

        PARAGRAPH (i)

          it expresses, on behalf of the consumer—

          SUBPARAGRAPH (i)

            an authorisation for any person acting on behalf of the supplier to enter any premises for the purposes of taking possession of goods to which the agreement relates;

          SUBPARAGRAPH (ii)

            an undertaking to sign in advance any documentation relating to enforcement of the agreement, irrespective of whether such documentation is complete or incomplete at the time it is signed; or

          SUBPARAGRAPH (iii)

            a consent to a predetermined value of costs relating to enforcement of the agreement, except to the extent that is consistent with this Act; or

          SUBPARAGRAPH (i)

            deposit with the supplier, or with any other person at the direction of the supplier, an identity document, credit or debit card, bank account or automatic teller machine access card, or any similar identifying document or device; or

            provide a personal identification code or number to be used to access an account.

      SUBSECTION (2)

        A supplier may not—

        PARAGRAPH (a)

        PARAGRAPH (b)

          request or demand a consumer to—

          SUBPARAGRAPH (i)

            give the supplier temporary or permanent possession of an instrument referred to in subsection (1)(j)(i) other than for the purpose of identification, or to make a copy of such instrument; or

            reveal any personal identification code or number contemplated in subsection (1)(j)(ii); or

        PARAGRAPH (c)

          direct, or knowingly permit, any other person to do anything referred to in this section on behalf or for the benefit of the supplier.

      SUBSECTION (3)

        A purported transaction or agreement, provision, term or condition of a transaction or agreement, or notice to which a transaction or agreement is purported to be subject, is void to the extent that it contravenes this section.

      SUBSECTION (4)

        This section does not preclude a supplier to require a personal identification code or number in order to facilitate a transaction that in the normal course of business necessitates the provision of such code or number.

      SUBSECTION (1)

        If, in any proceedings before a court concerning a transaction or agreement between a supplier and consumer, a person alleges that—

          the supplier contravened section 40, 41 or 48; and

        PARAGRAPH (b)

          this Act does not otherwise provide a remedy sufficient to correct the relevant prohibited conduct, unfairness, injustice or unconscionability,

        the court, after considering the principles, purposes and provisions of this Act, and the matters set out in subsection (2), may make an order contemplated in subsection (3).

      SUBSECTION (2)

        PARAGRAPH (d)

          the conduct of the supplier and the consumer, respectively;

        PARAGRAPH (e)

          whether there was any negotiation between the supplier and the consumer, and if so, the extent of that negotiation;

        PARAGRAPH (g)

          the extent to which any documents relating to the transaction or agreement satisfied the requirements of section 22;

        PARAGRAPH (h)

          whether the consumer knew or ought reasonably to have known of the existence and extent of any particular provision of the agreement that is alleged to have been unfair, unreasonable or unjust, having regard to any—

          SUBPARAGRAPH (i)

            custom of trade; and

          SUBPARAGRAPH (ii)

            any previous dealings between the parties;

      SUBSECTION (3)

        If the court determines that a transaction or agreement was, in whole or in part, unconscionable, unjust, unreasonable or unfair, the court may—

        PARAGRAPH (a)

          make a declaration to that effect; and

        PARAGRAPH (b)

          make any further order the court considers just and reasonable in the circumstances, including, but not limited to, an order—

          SUBPARAGRAPH (i)

            to restore money or property to the consumer;

      SUBSECTION (4)

        If, in any proceedings before a court concerning a transaction or agreement between a supplier and a consumer, a person alleges that an agreement, a term or condition of an agreement, or a notice to which a transaction or agreement is purportedly subject, is void in terms of this Act or failed to satisfy any applicable requirements set out in section 49, the court may—

        PARAGRAPH (a)

          make an order—

          SUBPARAGRAPH (i)

            in the case of a provision or notice that is void in terms of any provision of this Act—

            SUBPARAGRAPH (aa)

            SUBPARAGRAPH (bb)

              declaring the entire agreement, provision or notice void as from the date that it purportedly took effect; or

      SUBSECTION (1)

        When a supplier undertakes to perform any services for or on behalf of a consumer, the consumer has a right to—

          the timely performance and completion of those services, and timely notice of any unavoidable delay in the performance of the services;

          the return of any property or control over any property of the consumer in at least as good a condition as it was when the consumer made it available to the supplier for the purpose of performing such services,

        having regard to the circumstances of the supply, and any specific criteria or conditions agreed between the supplier and the consumer before or during the performance of the services.

      SUBSECTION (2)

        If a supplier fails to perform a service to the standards contemplated in subsection (1), the consumer may require the supplier to either—

        PARAGRAPH (a)

          remedy any defect in the quality of the services performed or goods supplied; or

        PARAGRAPH (b)

          refund to the consumer a reasonable portion of the price paid for the services performed and goods supplied, having regard to the extent of the failure.

    SECTION 55. - Consumer’s rights to safe, good quality goods

      SUBSECTION (1)

        This section does not apply to goods bought at an auction, as contemplated in section 45.

      SUBSECTION (2)

        Except to the extent contemplated in subsection (6), every consumer has a right to receive goods that—

        PARAGRAPH (a)

          are reasonably suitable for the purposes for which they are generally intended;

        PARAGRAPH (b)

          are of good quality, in good working order and free of any defects;

        PARAGRAPH (c)

          will be useable and durable for a reasonable period of time, having regard to the use to which they would normally be put and to all the surrounding circumstances of their supply; and

        PARAGRAPH (d)

          comply with any applicable standards set under the Standards Act, 1993 (Act No. 29 of 1993), or any other public regulation.

      SUBSECTION (3)

        In addition to the right set out in subsection (2)(a), if a consumer has specifically informed the supplier of the particular purpose for which the consumer wishes to acquire any goods, or the use to which the consumer intends to apply those goods, and the supplier—

        PARAGRAPH (a)

          ordinarily offers to supply such goods; or

        PARAGRAPH (b)

          acts in a manner consistent with being knowledgeable about the use of those goods,

        the consumer has a right to expect that the goods are reasonably suitable for the specific purpose that the consumer has indicated.

      SUBSECTION (4)

        In determining whether any particular goods satisfied the requirements of subsection (2) or (3), all of the circumstances of the supply of those goods must be considered, including but not limited to—

        PARAGRAPH (a)

          the range of things that might reasonably be anticipated to be done with or in relation to the goods; and

        PARAGRAPH (c)

          the time when the goods were produced and supplied.

      SUBSECTION (5)

        For greater certainty in applying subsection (4)—

        PARAGRAPH (a)

          it is irrelevant whether a product failure or defect was latent or patent, or whether it could have been detected by a consumer before taking delivery of the goods; and

        PARAGRAPH (b)

          a product failure or defect may not be inferred in respect of particular goods solely on the grounds that better goods have subsequently become available from the same or any other producer or supplier.

      SUBSECTION (6)

        Subsection (2)(a) and (b) do not apply to a transaction if the consumer—

        PARAGRAPH (a)

          has been expressly informed that particular goods were offered in a specific condition; and

        PARAGRAPH (b)

          has expressly agreed to accept the goods in that condition, or knowingly acted in a manner consistent with accepting the goods in that condition.

    SECTION 56. - Implied warranty of quality

      SUBSECTION (1)

        In any transaction or agreement pertaining to the supply of goods to a consumer there is an implied provision that the producer or importer, the distributor and the retailer each warrant that the goods comply with the requirements and standards contemplated in section 55, except to the extent that those goods have been altered contrary to the instructions, or after leaving the control, of the producer or importer, a distributor or the retailer, as the case may be.

      SUBSECTION (2)

        Within six months after the delivery of any goods to a consumer, the consumer may return the goods to the supplier, without penalty and at the supplier’s risk and expense, if the goods fail to satisfy the requirements and standards contemplated in section 55, and the supplier must, at the direction of the consumer, either—

        PARAGRAPH (a)

          repair or replace the failed, unsafe or defective goods; or

        PARAGRAPH (b)

          refund to the consumer the price paid by the consumer, for the goods.

      SUBSECTION (3)

        If a supplier repairs any particular goods or any component of any such goods, and within three months after that repair, the failure, defect or unsafe feature has not been remedied, or a further failure, defect or unsafe feature is discovered, the supplier must—

        PARAGRAPH (a)

          replace the goods; or

        PARAGRAPH (b)

          refund to the consumer the price paid by the consumer for the goods.

      SUBSECTION (4)

        The implied warranty imposed by subsection (1), and the right to return goods set out in subsection (2), are each in addition to—

        PARAGRAPH (a)

          any other implied warranty or condition imposed by the common law, this Act or any other public regulation; and

        PARAGRAPH (b)

      SUBSECTION (2)

        A warranty in terms of this section—

        PARAGRAPH (a)

          is concurrent with any other deemed, implied or express warranty;

        PARAGRAPH (b)

          is void if the consumer has subjected the part, or the goods or property in which it was installed, to misuse or abuse; and

        PARAGRAPH (c)

          does not apply to ordinary wear and tear, having regard to the circumstances in which the goods are intended to ordinarily be used.

    SECTION 58. - Warning concerning fact and nature of risks

      SUBSECTION (1)

        The supplier of any activity or facility that is subject to any—

        PARAGRAPH (a)

          risk of an unusual character or nature;

        PARAGRAPH (b)

          risk of which a consumer could not reasonably be expected to be aware, or which an ordinarily alert consumer could not reasonably be expected to contemplate, in the circumstances; or

        PARAGRAPH (c)

          risk that could result in serious injury or death,

        must specifically draw the fact, nature and potential effect of that risk to the attention of consumers in a form and manner that meets the standards set out in section 49.

      SUBSECTION (2)

        A person who packages any hazardous or unsafe goods for supply to consumers must display on or within that packaging a notice that meets the requirements of section 22, and any other applicable standards, providing the consumer with adequate instructions for the safe handling and use of those goods.

      SUBSECTION (3)

        Subsection (2) does not apply to any hazardous or unsafe goods to the extent that a substantially similar label or notice has been applied in terms of any other public regulation.

      SUBSECTION (4)

        A person who installs any hazardous or unsafe goods contemplated in subsection

      SUBSECTION (2)

        for a consumer, or supplies any such goods to a consumer in conjunction with the performance of any services, must give the consumer the original copy of—

        PARAGRAPH (a)

          any document required in terms of that subsection; or

        PARAGRAPH (b)

          any similar document applied to those goods in terms of another public regulation.

          any person who in the ordinary course of business supplies goods of that kind to consumers, must accept the return of any such goods, components, remnants, containers or packaging from any consumer, without charge to the consumer, irrespective of whether that person supplied the particular object to that particular consumer; and

        PARAGRAPH (b)

          any person who in the ordinary course of business produces, imports or distributes any such goods as part of the supply chain by which those goods

      SUBSECTION (2)

        If any regulation or industry waste management plan approved by any other legislation for the management of a specific waste type applies, the consumer may dispose or deposit the goods to a collection facility provided for in the regulation or industry waste management plan.

          SUBPARAGRAPH (i)

            consumer complaints or reports of product failures, defects or hazards;

          SUBPARAGRAPH (ii)

            the return of any goods because of a failure, defect or hazard;

          SUBPARAGRAPH (iii)

            personal injury, illness or damage to property caused wholly or partially as a result of a product failure, defect or hazard; and

            other indication of failure, defect or hazard,

          in any particular goods or in any component of them, or injury or damage resulting from the use of those goods;

        PARAGRAPH (b)

          monitor the sources of information contemplated in paragraph (a), and analyse the information received with the object of detecting or identifying any previously undetected or unrecognised potential risk to the public from the use of or exposure to those goods;

        PARAGRAPH (c)

          conduct investigations into the nature, causes, extent and degree of the risk to the public;

        PARAGRAPH (d)

          notify consumers of the nature, causes, extent and degree of the risk pertaining to those goods; and

          if the goods are unsafe, recall those goods for repair, replacement or refund.

      SUBSECTION (2)

        If the Commission has reasonable grounds to believe that any goods may be unsafe, or that there is a potential risk to the public from the continued use of or exposure to the goods, and the producer or importer of those goods has not taken any steps required by an applicable code contemplated in subsection (1), the Commission, by written notice, may require that producer to—

        PARAGRAPH (a)

          conduct an investigation contemplated in subsection (1); or

        PARAGRAPH (b)

          carry out a recall programme on any terms required by the Commission.

        A producer or importer affected by a notice issued in terms of subsection (2) may apply to the Tribunal to set aside the notice in whole or in part.

    SECTION 61. - Liability for damage caused by goods

      SUBSECTION (1)

        Except to the extent contemplated in subsection (4), the producer or importer, distributor or retailer of any goods is liable for any harm, as described in subsection (5), caused wholly or partly as a consequence of—

        PARAGRAPH (a)

          supplying any unsafe goods;

        PARAGRAPH (b)

          a product failure, defect or hazard in any goods; or

        PARAGRAPH (c)

          inadequate instructions or warnings provided to the consumer pertaining to any hazard arising from or associated with the use of any goods,

        irrespective of whether the harm resulted from any negligence on the part of the producer, importer, distributor or retailer, as the case may be.

      SUBSECTION (2)

        A supplier of services who, in conjunction with the performance of those services, applies, supplies, installs or provides access to any goods, must be regarded as a supplier of those goods to the consumer, for the purposes of this section.

      SUBSECTION (3)

        If, in a particular case, more than one person is liable in terms of this section, their liability is joint and several.

      SUBSECTION (4)

        Liability of a particular person in terms of this section does not arise if—

        PARAGRAPH (a)

          the unsafe product characteristic, failure, defect or hazard that results in harm is wholly attributable to compliance with any public regulation;

        PARAGRAPH (b)

          the alleged unsafe product characteristic, failure, defect or hazard—

          SUBPARAGRAPH (i)

            did not exist in the goods at the time it was supplied by that person to another person alleged to be liable; or

          SUBPARAGRAPH (ii)

            was wholly attributable to compliance by that person with instructions provided by the person who supplied the goods to that person, in which case subparagraph (i) does not apply;

        PARAGRAPH (c)

          it is unreasonable to expect the distributor or retailer to have discovered the unsafe product characteristic, failure, defect or hazard, having regard to that person’s role in marketing the goods to consumers; or

        PARAGRAPH (d)

          the claim for damages is brought more than three years after the—

          SUBPARAGRAPH (i)

            death or injury of a person contemplated in subsection (5)(a);

          SUBPARAGRAPH (ii)

            earliest time at which a person had knowledge of the material facts about an illness contemplated in subsection (5)(b); or

          SUBPARAGRAPH (iii)

            earliest time at which a person with an interest in any property had knowledge of the material facts about the loss or damage to that property contemplated in subsection (5)(c); or

          SUBPARAGRAPH (iv)

            the latest date on which a person suffered any economic loss contemplated in subsection (5)(d).

      SUBSECTION (5)

        Harm for which a person may be held liable in terms of this section includes—

        PARAGRAPH (a)

          the death of, or injury to, any natural person;

        PARAGRAPH (b)

          an illness of any natural person;

        PARAGRAPH (c)

          any loss of, or physical damage to, any property, irrespective of whether it is movable or immovable; and

        PARAGRAPH (d)

          any economic loss that results from harm contemplated in paragraph (a), (b)

        or (c).

      SUBSECTION (6)

        Nothing in this section limits the authority of a court to—

        PARAGRAPH (a)

          assess whether any harm has been proven and adequately mitigated;

        PARAGRAPH (b)

          determine the extent and monetary value of any damages, including economic loss; or

        PARAGRAPH (c)

          apportion liability among persons who are found to be jointly and severally liable.

        If a supplier agrees to sell particular goods to a consumer, to accept payment for those goods in periodic instalments, and to hold those goods until the consumer has paid the full price for the goods—

        PARAGRAPH (a)

          each amount paid by the consumer to the supplier remains the property of the consumer, and is subject to section 65, until the goods have been delivered to the consumer; and

        PARAGRAPH (b)

          the particular goods remain at the risk of the supplier until the goods have been delivered to the consumer.

      SUBSECTION (2)

          supply the consumer with an equivalent quantity of goods that are comparable or superior in description, design and quality; or

            the money paid by the consumer, with interest in accordance with the Prescribed Rate of Interest Act, 1975 (Act No. 55 of 1975), if the inability to supply the goods is due to circumstances beyond the supplier’s control; or

      SUBSECTION (3)

        Without limiting the generality of subsection (2)(b)(i), a failure to supply the goods is not "due to circumstances beyond the supplier’s control" if the shortage results partially, completely, directly or indirectly from a failure on the part of the supplier to adequately and diligently carry out any ordinary or routine matter pertaining to the supplier’s business.

      SUBSECTION (4)

        If a consumer contemplated in subsection (1) terminates the agreement before fully paying for the goods, or fails to complete the payment for the goods within 60 business days after the anticipated date of completion, the supplier—

        PARAGRAPH (a)

          may charge a termination penalty in respect of those goods, subject to subsections (5) and (6); and

          after deducting any such termination penalty, must refund to the consumer any amount paid by the consumer under that agreement.

      SUBSECTION (5)

        A cancellation penalty contemplated in subsection (4) may not be charged—

        PARAGRAPH (a)

          if the consumer’s failure to complete payment was due to the death or hospitalisation of the consumer; or

        PARAGRAPH (b)

          in any other case, unless the supplier informed the consumer of the fact and extent of the penalty before the consumer entered into the lay-by agreement.

      SUBSECTION (6)

        A prepaid certificate, card, credit, voucher or similar device contemplated in subsection (1) does not expire until the earlier of—

        PARAGRAPH (b)

          any amount in respect of services or access to services to be provided at a date more than 25 business days after the payment is made, other than by way of a prepayment device contemplated in section 63,

      SUBSECTION (3)

        If a supplier intends to close a facility to which the supplier has committed to provide future access in terms of an agreement with a consumer to provide any service, without making available a reasonably accessible alternative facility, the supplier must—
