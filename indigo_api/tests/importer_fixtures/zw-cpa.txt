          ordinarily offers to supply such goods or services; or

        PARAGRAPH (b)

          acts in a manner consistent with being knowledgeable about the use or provision of those goods or services;

        the consumer has a right to expect that they are reasonably suitable for the specific purpose that the consumer has indicated.

      SUBSECTION (4)

        In determining whether any particular goods or services satisfy the requirements of subsection (2), all of the circumstances of the supply of those goods or services must be considered, including but not limited to—

          or

        PARAGRAPH (b)

        Subsections (3) and (4) do not apply to a transaction if the consumer has—

        PARAGRAPH (a)

        PARAGRAPH (c)

          any person who has imported the product into the country in order, in the course of any business of his or hers, to supply it to another;

        PARAGRAPH (d)

          the distributor, retailer or supplier of goods.

      SUBSECTION (2)

        Except as contemplated in subsection (5), the producer, importer, distributor or retailer of any goods is liable for any harm, as described in subsection (4), caused wholly or partly as a consequence of—

          supplying any unsafe goods; or

          a product failure, defect or hazard in any goods; or

          inadequate instructions or warnings provided to the consumer pertaining to any hazard arising from or associated with the use of any goods, irrespective of whether the harm resulted from any negligence on the part of the supplier, producer, importer, distributor or retailer, as the case may be.

      SUBSECTION (3)

        A supplier of services who, in conjunction with the performance of those services, applies, supplies, installs or provides access to any goods, must be regarded as a supplier of those goods to the consumer, for the purposes of this section.

        PARAGRAPH (b)

          the alleged unsafe product characteristic, failure, defect or hazard—

          SUBPARAGRAPH (i)

          SUBPARAGRAPH (ii)

            was wholly attributable to compliance by that person with instructions provided by the person who supplied the goods to that person, in which case the person who has provided such instructions shall be liable;

          or

        PARAGRAPH (c)

          it is unreasonable to expect the distributor or retailer to have discovered the unsafe product characteristic, failure, defect or hazard, having regard to that person’s role in marketing the goods to consumers.

            the death or injury of a person contemplated in subsection (2)(a); or

          SUBPARAGRAPH (ii)

            the earliest time at which a person had knowledge of the material facts about an illness contemplated in subsection (2)(b); or

          SUBPARAGRAPH (iii)

        Nothing in this section limits the authority of a court to—

        PARAGRAPH (a)

          assess whether any harm has been proven and adequately mitigated; or

        PARAGRAPH (b)

          determine the extent and monetary value of any damages, including economic loss; or

        PARAGRAPH (c)

          apportion liability among persons who are found to be jointly and severally liable.

      SUBSECTION (4)

        In determining for the purposes of this Sub-Part who has suffered any loss of or damage to property and when any such loss or damage occurred, the loss or damage shall be regarded as having occurred at the earliest time at which a person with an interest in the property had knowledge of the material facts about the loss or damage.

        SUBPARAGRAPH (i)

        SUBPARAGRAPH (ii)

        PARAGRAPH (b)

          the goods or services have been delivered to the consumer; and—

          SUBPARAGRAPH (i)

            he or she tampers with the goods in a manner inconsistent with the supplier’s ownership of the same; or

        PARAGRAPH (b)

          solely on the ground that a consumer contract contains a scheduled provision if the contract was concluded before the provision concerned became a scheduled provision:

          it does not result in substantial or real benefit to a party; or
